# employeeTracker

The command-line application should allow users to:

  * Add departments, roles, employees

  * View departments, roles, employees

  * Update employee roles

  This application is able to view data, update roles and add departments and roles. It cannot add employees.

  I used separate functions for everything, I will try to work on using a class to condense my code
